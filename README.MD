## _Features & Issues_

- [ ] add tooltips to icons to display their names on hover || <!--! fix rotation / implement better tooltips-->
- [ ] transition to typescript
- [ ] section/=>activeSection in wheelSection & Wheel doesn't need the selected state, only the name
- [ ] add \_ to ARROWPATHS & SVGPATHS
- [ ] Embed my sites into this portfolio so I don't have to totally redirect them from my site just to view one project
- [x] Try to fix glitching icon bugs on load and on switch
- [x] make icons with links a different color on mobile cos they can't be hovered on to know the difference
- [~] if svg position is left, move the icon from the left pos to the right one smoothly (not needed because of fading animation)
